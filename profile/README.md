## Common Mistakes and Solutions

When solving the **Raven Sword Puzzle**, players often encounter certain challenges. Below are some of the most common mistakes and their solutions to help you overcome them and successfully unlock the **Balmung Raven Sword**:

1. **Incorrect Symbol Alignment**  
   - **Problem**: Players often misalign the symbols on the puzzle wheel, which prevents the puzzle from being solved.  
   - **Solution**: Ensure that both the zodiac sign and corresponding element symbol are aligned at the bottom of the wheel. Double-check each combination (e.g., Horn = Fire + Aries) to avoid errors. Use the inner ring (L1) and outer ring (R1) to align the symbols precisely in the **Raven Sword Puzzle**.

2. **Misunderstanding Element Directions**  
   - **Problem**: Confusion about the direction of element symbols can lead to incorrect inputs, such as rotating the symbol in the wrong direction.  
   - **Solution**: Pay close attention to the direction of the element symbols in the **Raven Sword Puzzle**. For example, the **Water** symbol should have a downward arrow (upside-down triangle), while **Fire** has an upward triangle. Always ensure that the symbol's orientation is correct.

3. **Not Using the Right Artifact**  
   - **Problem**: Players may overlook the importance of the specific artifact they have found and its corresponding zodiac and element combinations.  
   - **Solution**: Each artifact corresponds to a specific zodiac and element combination in the **Raven Sword Puzzle**. Be sure to note which artifact you have found (Horn, Jaw Bone, Scorpion Fossil, etc.) and use the correct zodiac and element pair for the puzzle.

4. **Orb Collection Failures**  
   - **Problem**: After solving the puzzle, players sometimes fail to guide all three orbs into the void tears, preventing progress.  
   - **Solution**: Carefully maneuver the orbs and guide them one by one into each void tear in the **Raven Sword Puzzle**. Remember, each void tear requires three orbs to be successfully collected. Take your time and avoid rushing to prevent mistakes.

5. **Technical Glitches**  
   - **Problem**: Occasionally, technical issues may prevent players from interacting with puzzle elements, such as the dial or orbs, due to bugs or glitches.  
   - **Solution**: If you encounter glitches in the **Raven Sword Puzzle**, try restarting the game or checking for updates to resolve any technical issues. If problems persist, consult community forums or technical support for advice.

6. **Rushing Through Steps**  
   - **Problem**: Players sometimes rush through the puzzle without fully understanding the steps or completing each stage thoroughly.  
   - **Solution**: Take your time with each step of the **Raven Sword Puzzle**, especially when solving symbol alignments or guiding the orbs. Ensure that each part of the puzzle is completed properly before moving on to avoid unnecessary mistakes.

By being aware of these common mistakes and following the solutions provided, you’ll be able to solve the **Raven Sword Puzzle** more effectively and unlock the powerful **Balmung Raven Sword** with ease.
